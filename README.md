# Funfacts

Start the application by running

```
$ npm install
$ node wikiproxy.js
```

... and serve funfacts.html from an HTTP server, like (with Python 2):

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4321
```

Then point the browser to the HTTP server's URL, like:

[http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

Good luck!
